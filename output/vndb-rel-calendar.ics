And the the most famous of all the Jindou performances is the "Daihouen".\n\nSuzakuin Nadeshiko\, although currently still a school student\, has been fantastically making a name for herself as a pro swordswoman. On the other side\, the protagonist Takizawa Kazuma\, a washed-up pro swordsman\, competes in underground Jindou matches to make ends meet.\n\nOne day\, these two who were born and lived in completely different worlds had a fateful meeting.\n\n"Kazuma-san\, your swordsmanship is the real deal. Fight with us in the Daihouen and let's make it to the top!"\n\n"...yeah. If we could that'd be great"\n\nThe pair\, captivated by Jindou\, are drawn to each other's swordsmanship and seek each other. With Takizawa Komari and Hanabusa Palvi joining Team White Wolf too\, they eventually make big waves on the stage of the Daihouen.\n\nIf they win\, glory awaits. If they lose\, they fall from grace. With their beliefs held in their breasts\, the swordsmen step out into a battle they can't afford to lose in the intense world of pros.\n\nSwordsmen live in the moment. The "moment" you let slip will never come back-- in which case\, set your soul alight.\n\n[Translated from the [url=https://crystalia.amusecraft.com/kakehana/about.html]official website[/url]]

DESCRIPTION:https:///vndb.org/v47880\nIn the 2040s in Japan\, the near-future sport "Jindou" boasts a high popularity as the sport of the people. And the the most famous of all the Jindou performances is the "Daihouen".\n\nSuzakuin Nadeshiko\, although currently still a school student\, has been fantastically making a name for herself as a pro swordswoman. On the other side\, the protagonist Takizawa Kazuma\, a washed-up pro swordsman\, competes in underground Jindou matches to make ends meet.\n\nOne day\, these two who were born and lived in completely different worlds had a fateful meeting.\n\n"Kazuma-san\, your swordsmanship is the real deal. Fight with us in the Daihouen and let's make it to the top!"\n\n"...yeah. If we could that'd be great"\n\nThe pair\, captivated by Jindou\, are drawn to each other's swordsmanship and seek each other. With Takizawa Komari and Hanabusa Palvi joining Team White Wolf too\, they eventually make big waves on the stage of the Daihouen.\n\nIf they win\, glory awaits. If they lose\, they fall from grace. With their beliefs held in their breasts\, the swordsmen step out into a battle they can't afford to lose in the intense world of pros.\n\nSwordsmen live in the moment. The "moment" you let slip will never come back-- in which case\, set your soul alight.\n\n[Translated from the [url=https://crystalia.amusecraft.com/kakehana/about.html]official website[/url]]

All love and fantasies are gathered in a beautiful yokai girl\; she is this "dream"!\n\nThis is also an electronic love letter\, written to the "dream girl" in my heart. If\, while reading this letter\, you can empathize even slightly\, and be warmed and comforted by this smiling "dream girl\," then that would be wonderful.\n\nI hope that you\, in front of the screen\, can also find your own "dream girl\," even if it's only in your "heart" or in your "dreams."\n\n[Translated from [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2539790/]Steam[/url]]\nEstimated on "2024"

DESCRIPTION:https:///vndb.org/v47105\nShe was your senior in T University\, aged 29. After years of separation\, you meet her again in the workplace. During your school days\, you were inseparable\, whether it was during classes or leisure time\, her presence was almost always around. However\, just before graduation\, she suddenly lost contact\, and it was only after many years that you accidentally discovered that you were both working in the same film and television company. Unfortunately\, she was already married...\n\nJust when you were feeling hopeless\, you and your senior were sent by the God to the "room where you cannot leave without having sex". The rules here are exactly as they sound\, you can only leave if you have sex\, otherwise\, you will be imprisoned forever. Under the mental pressure of being imprisoned\, you and your senior got involved. You thought it would end there\, but from that day on\, God would send you back to that room every single day. Is this God's prank or a response to your wishes?\n\nAfter that\, you and your senior continuously convinced yourselves that your relationship only existed in that room. Once you returned to reality\, you should pretend that nothing had happened and continue with your separate lives. However\, the human heart is not that easy to separate. You keep struggling with the moral dilemma\, and gradually\, you become unable to distinguish the boundaries between yourselves. You engage in taboo sexual acts and develop indescribable emotions towards each other.\n\n[From [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2329630/]Steam[/url]]\nEstimated on "2024"
